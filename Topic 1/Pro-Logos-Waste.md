1. Resource Efficiency – Proper waste segregation ensures that recyclable materials, such as paper, plastics, and metals, are processed correctly, reducing the demand for raw materials. This conserves natural resources and decreases energy consumption in manufacturing.

2. Reduced Environmental Impact – Segregated waste minimizes landfill overflow and prevents hazardous materials from contaminating soil and water. This leads to a healthier environment, reducing long-term cleanup and health costs.
