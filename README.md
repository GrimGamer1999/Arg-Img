# Arg-Img

This repository explores how images affect the persuasive strength of arguments across five topics. Each topic has a Pro and Con stance, with each stance presented using two rhetorical appeals, Logos (logical) and Pathos (emotional). Each stance-appeal pairing includes an image and two supporting arguments.

This repository contains the supplementary material to the anonymous paper submission "Assessing the Persuasive Effect of AI-Generated Image Support of Arguments"
