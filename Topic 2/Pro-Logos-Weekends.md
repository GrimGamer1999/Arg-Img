1. Consumer Convenience – Many people have busy work schedules during the week, making weekends the most practical time for grocery shopping. Keeping supermarkets open ensures accessibility and accommodates diverse lifestyles.

2. Reduced Shopping Congestion – If supermarkets close on weekends, customers may overcrowd stores on weekdays, leading to longer queues and stock shortages. Weekend operations help distribute shopping traffic more evenly.
