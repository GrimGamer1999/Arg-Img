1. Encourages Mindful Shopping – If supermarkets were closed on weekends, people would plan their shopping better instead of making frequent, last-minute trips. This could reduce food waste and encourage healthier spending habits.

2. Workers Deserve Time with Family – Supermarket employees also have families and personal lives. Keeping stores open on weekends forces them to work when others rest, depriving them of quality time with loved ones.
