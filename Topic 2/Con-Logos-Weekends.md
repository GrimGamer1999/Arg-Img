1. Employee Well-being – Weekend shifts can disrupt work-life balance for supermarket employees, reducing their time for rest, family, and personal activities. This may lead to higher job dissatisfaction and turnover rates.

2. Increased Operational Costs – Running supermarkets on weekends adds expenses related to staffing, utilities, and maintenance. For smaller businesses, these additional costs may outweigh the benefits of staying open.
