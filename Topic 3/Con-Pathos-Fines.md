1. Punishing Instead of Educating – Instead of slapping dog owners with heavy fines, why not invest in awareness campaigns and more waste bins? People are more likely to change their behavior when they feel supported, not threatened.

2. Unfair to Low-Income Pet Owners – A hefty fine might not matter to some, but for struggling pet owners, it could mean choosing between food and paying a penalty. There are better ways to encourage responsibility without financial hardship.
