1. Cost of Cleanup – Municipalities spend significant resources on cleaning dog waste from streets. Stricter fines would shift the financial burden onto negligent owners instead of taxpayers, encouraging responsible pet ownership.

2. Public Health and Hygiene – Dog waste carries harmful bacteria and parasites that can contaminate public spaces, posing health risks, especially to children and immunocompromised individuals. Higher fines would deter irresponsible owners and promote cleaner environments.
