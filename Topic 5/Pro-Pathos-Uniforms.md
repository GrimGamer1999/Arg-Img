1. Promotes School Unity and Pride – Wearing a uniform fosters a sense of belonging, making students feel part of a team. It strengthens school identity and encourages discipline, preparing students for professional life.

2. Prevents Bullying and Social Pressure – Without uniforms, students from low-income families may feel embarrassed about their clothes, while wealthier students flaunt expensive brands. Uniforms create a sense of equality and reduce discrimination.
